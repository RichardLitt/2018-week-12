Well, that's done. I've learned more about GitHub Pages' [seo module](https://github.com/jekyll/jekyll-seo-tag), added a logo and Google Analytics, a favicon and some social icons.

I tried to get the domain to deliver from https://2018-week-12.burntfen.com, but unfortunately GitHub doesn't make this easy. I've called Hover about it, and they couldn't help me, either. I have to set up a CNAME pointing to `RichardLitt.github.io`, which is odd, as it isn't the site I'm building as that that site is actually hosted on Netlify, not on GitHub Pages. Right now, it shows a 404 on GitHub, which shows that at least the CNAME is set up somewhat alright, but it doesn't work at all with SSL, which expects to render on a `*.github.io` site. Nothing more to do but email support and wait.

So, that's done. What's next? The Node.js i18n committee.
