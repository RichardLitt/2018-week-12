And that's done. I took longer than I had planned to sort through all of my old todo lists from the past two months, identify projects, and to make progress where it was expedient to do so (under ten minutes work, mainly). Yesterday, I mostly organised and performed basic admin work; started planning a trip to Vermont to go hiking in the Adirondacks this weekend; [submitted a request](https://github.com/nodejs/admin/pull/100) for funding to go to JSConf and the Node Collab Summit in Berlin this May; sent money to Germany for my tuition payment; killed a collaborative project that wasn't working for either me or my collaborator; posted a new submission to [Word Hoard Press](https://wordhoardpress.com); did Maintainer tickets, and so on. The list continues. This morning, I wrote Maintainer emails and planned a long trip to Pennsylvania for late April.

Now, I have only a few major projects left for the next few weeks; mostly In Development, Maintainer, 2117.91 catchup, and launching Jekyll Scheduler. And, of course, my thesis.

It's not ideal that it took me until Wednesday to get back to this, or that it took a full day to get progress on all of my projects. But that's just how things are for me - somewhat scattered, with a lot of parallel threads occuring simultaneously that take time. My thesis is the largest thread that I can easily snip, to make sure it never comes back again. Let's work on that.

The goal for the day: write and finish the section on endangered language metrics.
