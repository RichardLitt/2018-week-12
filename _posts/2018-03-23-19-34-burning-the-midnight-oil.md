I haven't wanted to update this blog over the past few days, because I've been either unproductive or my efforts have switched between different tasks. Publicising my procrastination doesn't seem like a clever move.

But, it's 7:30 tonight, and I'm sat down for another four and a half hours of work. I've got some chai tea, a pen and paper, and I'm not getting up until midnight. So, I figured now was as good a time as any to keep this going, even if it isn't momentous, if it isn't interesting, and if no one is reading.

First things first: I want to check the issues on this repository and close them all.

```sh
19:31 ~/src/2018-week-12 (master) üêï  ghi
# RichardLitt/2018-week-12 open issues
  7: Add Social Media icons
  6: Add Twitter Card or OG graph links
  5: Add a favicon
  4: Improve draft process
  3: Improve SEO tags
  2: Serve from burntfen.com
  1: Add Google Analytics
```

Let's see if I can close all of these.
