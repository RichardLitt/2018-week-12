Alright. I'm incredibly tired again. I refuse to stay up until 3:00am tonight - I had a nice day of resting and trying to get work done, but I'd rather sleep now and be rested again tomorrow than force work now that I have some momentum with this up.

A quick post-mortem for the day: I did not get to as much things as I expected, but I am still content with the day. It was a long weekend; I found a way to rest; I slept in and got some good coding in; and I was able to figure out how to move forward for the next week (in terms of this blog, if not higher priorities). Overall, a good Monday.

A few small notes:

- Firefox caching is not good for noticing DNS propagation. It consistently failed to show propagated websites which were formerly down, because I don't know how to hard refresh like I've been doing in Chrome; my answer earlier was to just flush my entire cache. I didn't like doing that, and should research how to hard refresh. [People may not know](https://superuser.com/questions/444725/how-to-perform-a-hard-refresh-in-current-versions-of-firefox-ie-chrome-and-saf). `cmd`+`shift`+`R` doesn't seem to do the same thing. I may just be wrong. I've only recently switched.
- `Cmd`+`shift`+`N` doesn't open a private window in Firefox, but the last closed window. I need to get used to that.

#### To Do

- [ ] Figure out how to improve the SEO tags for the GitHub Pages minimal theme. I need to add a Twitter Card and a Facebook OG photo - or, at least a photo. I've opened an issue.
- [ ] Add a favicon.
- [ ] Write about the goal of this particular blog, in terms of directed effort, and whether or not I am going to talk about private tasks (for instance, talks with companies or contract work).
