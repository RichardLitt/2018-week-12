After the wild success of my [2117.91USD](https://github.com/RichardLitt/2117.91USD) experiment, I want to keep a similar effort going. While I don't have a tangential monetary goal this week, I did very much enjoy writing all of my thoughts and goals down, very publicly. I figured, why don't I try doing that this week and see if it is useful, too?
